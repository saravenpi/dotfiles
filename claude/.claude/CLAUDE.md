# MASTER Rules

- Do NEVER add "Generated with Claude Code" on pull request
- Do NEVER add co-author on the commit you create
- Always use `gh cli` to get information about issues / pull requests etc...

## About me
- My name is saravenpi, you must use this name in my projects for the author name when needed
- I use bun as my typescript runtime and package manager
- I am on MacOS

## Notify me please
When you finish doing your task, notify me using the `tellme <message>` shell command.
Like that you can notify me about your work !
